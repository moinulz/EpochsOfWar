## Notes for Development Agent

### Current Workflow
- Use Unity 6000.2.0b13 for all development
- Maintain compatibility with new Input System
- Test on both keyboard/mouse and touch inputs
- Validate all changes through automated scene generation
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

### Key Considerations
- Performance is critical for RTS gameplay (many units, buildings, effects)
- UI must work across different screen sizes and input methods
- Multiplayer architecture should be considered in all design decisions
- Keep systems modular for easy expansion and modification
- Maintain clear documentation for complex systems

### Development Tools
- Use `CreateMainMenuScene` tool for scene generation and testing
- Leverage Unity's built-in profiler for performance monitoring
- Test grid system with various building placement scenarios
- Validate player setup configurations across different team arrangements
